# FugsOpusMV

Use OGG OPUS files in RPG Maker MV with looping! 

RPG Maker MV doesn't know how to read loop data from the newer OPUS
standard of OGG audio files. This plugin overwrites WebAudio._readOgg to
find the loop tags and sample rate.

Note: Opus files still won't preview in the editor but at least
they will loop in game now!

## Install
Just move to your plugins folder and activate the plugin in your plugin manager.

No options!
